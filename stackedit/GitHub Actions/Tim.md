The Dream: 3 steps to Prod / Continous Deployment

  

The Survey team does continuous deployment and has the lowest cycle time. They may be a pattern to model the "happy path" workflow.

  

Recover and Health Activity release daily. They are also worth investigating.

  

Carlos: Feels more confident about laying out a path. Eric and Carlos now have more experience with how GitHub Action can work within Rally.

  

To-do:

- Define the end goal

- Roadmap, i.e.:

  1. #. Phase 1: Does it work
    
    2. Phase 2: Dogfood it
    
    2. Phase 3: SOC2 compliance signoff
    
    4. Phase 4: RFC and Cost projections

 4. Observability / Usage metrics

 5. Are people adopting it?

 6. Billing

  

We need to provide:

- Tim: Sane defaults

- Carlos: An opinionated stack
