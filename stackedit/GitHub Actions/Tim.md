The Dream: 3 steps to Prod / Continous Deployment

The Survey team does continuous deployment and has the lowest cycle time. They may be a pattern to model the "happy path" workflow.

Recover and Health Activity release daily. They are also worth investigating.

Carlos: Feels more confident about laying out a path. Eric and Carlos now have more experience with how GitHub Action can work within Rally.

To-do:

- Define the end goal
- Roadmap, i.e.:
  1. Phase 1: Does it work
  2. Phase 2: Dogfood it
  3. Phase 3: SOC2 compliance signoff
  4. Phase 4: RFC and Cost projection
- Observability / Usage metrics
  - Are people adopting it?
  - Billing

We need to provide:

- Tim: Sane defaults
- Carlos: An opinionated stack
