# 2021-07-29 Meeting Notes w/ Chris V

Chris like GitHub Actions because no additional code had to be written because of off the shelf Actions. Also, Chris expects better consistency from GitHub Actions over the Jenkins infra.

Chris is was blocked on pushing to Artifactory.
Tiger shared the test repo and action-artifact-access.
