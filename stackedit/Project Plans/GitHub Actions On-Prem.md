## Problem
* Customizable Jenkins controllers for each team is not scalable or sustable from a maintance and support perspective.
* Teams utilize plugins of their choosing. This is not longer a supportable consitant platform; the problem amplifies with scale.
* Team controllers with indiviual setting pose a security risk with miss configuration and insecure or unpatched plugins.
* CloudBees Jenkins has non trivial over costs in both infrastructure and licensing/support.

## Why
* GitHub Actions provides a homoginized platform.
  * Lower engineering resources required to support

### Costs
* Lower infrastructure requirements for On-Prem GitHub Actions when compared to Jenkins.
* No additional licensing costs for On-Prem GitHub Actions.

# Questions
* Are there security, inteletcural property, or personal identifying information concerns or policies in reguards to using SasS CI build tools, such as GitHub Actions?
* What is our licening and support cost to CloudBees?

## To Jenkins advocates
* How much time is spent interacting with the Jenkins build system?
* How much of that time is spent troubleshooting the build system (vs the actual build)?
* How much does the Jenkins build improve the effientcy of your team? (1-5)
