# CI/CD

## Vision

Automate commit to release.

## Problem

We want dev teams to do CI/CD with the GitOps. We should adopt such practices and workflows prior to prescribing them to other teams

## Requirements

- Conventional commits
    - Automate changelogs
    - Automate release on merge (version can be determine by commits, i.e. fix vs docs) 
- Bulldozer to merge CI created PRs
