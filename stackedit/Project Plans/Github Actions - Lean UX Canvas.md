# Business Problem

 - The current Jenkins platform
	 - a lot of maintaince and engineer engagment time
	 - produces serveral support requests per day (including #jenkins-smes, SO, Jira tickets)
	 - difficult to scale because platform is non-homogenous as every team is allowed to modify their controller
	 - security conideration since each team can configure their controller without best practices
	 - incured monitary cost from CloudBees licening and support
 - The current CI is very customized making it non-intuative, especially to new engineers

# Business Outcome
 - reduced costs when team run soley on Github Actions

# Users and Customers

 - CI / Jenkins Platform Engineers
 - Operation Engineers
 - Development Engineers

# User Benifets

 - Faster onboarding and
 - Less support
 - Reduced platform maintance as enviroment is enphemeral
 
# Solution Ideas

 - A more lossely coupled CI platform to process.
 - 

# Hypotheses
# Whatâ€™s the most important thing we need to learn first?

 - Will this be adopted?
 - Features required / prioritize.

# Minimal Usable Product (a.k.a. MVP)
